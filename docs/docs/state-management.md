# State Management

This document explains the state management approach used in the Crypto Price Tracker application.

## Chosen Approach: React Query

I chose [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for state management in this application. React Query is a powerful data-fetching and state management library that handles server state efficiently.

### Why React Query?

1. **Server State Management**: React Query is specifically designed for managing server state, which is perfect for our cryptocurrency data that comes from an external API.

2. **Built-in Caching**: It provides sophisticated caching mechanisms out of the box, reducing unnecessary network requests.

3. **Loading & Error States**: React Query automatically tracks loading, error, and success states, making it easy to provide feedback to users.

4. **Refetching Strategies**: It offers flexible refetching strategies, including manual refetching, interval-based refetching, and refetching on window focus.

5. **Devtools**: React Query comes with excellent devtools for debugging and monitoring queries.

### Managing UI State

For UI-specific state that doesn't come from the server, I use React's built-in `useState` hook:

This approach keeps our state management simple and focused:

- React Query for server state (API data)
- React's useState for UI state (search filters, etc.)

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Context API + useReducer

**Pros:**

- Built into React
- Good for complex state logic
- No additional dependencies

**Cons:**

- Requires more boilerplate code
- No built-in caching or data fetching capabilities
- Would need to manually implement loading/error states

### Zustand

**Pros:**

- Lightweight and simple API
- Works well with TypeScript
- Minimal boilerplate

**Cons:**

- Better suited for global UI state than server state
- Would need to combine with a data fetching solution
- Less specialized for handling async data

## Why I Chose React Query Over Alternatives

For this specific application, React Query provides the best balance of features:

1. **Specialized for API Data**: Our app primarily deals with data from an external API, which is React Query's specialty.

2. **Developer Experience**: React Query reduces boilerplate and provides a great developer experience with automatic loading/error states.

3. **Performance**: The built-in caching and refetching strategies help optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API calls.

4. **Scalability**: As the application grows, React Query's patterns scale well without becoming unwieldy.

## Future Considerations

As the application evolves, I might consider:

- Adding Zustand for complex global UI state if needed
- Implementing optimistic updates for any mutation operations
- Setting up prefetching strategies for improved user experience
